# ScoreboardWrapper
An open-source scoreboard API

# Usage:
  1. Make a new class IMPLEMENTING the SidebarProvider class
  2. Initialize the 'ScoreboardManager' class with your JavaPlugin instance
  3. Invoke the method 'setProvider' on the previously initialized instance of ScoreboardManager, using an instance of the created SidebarProvider class.
  4. You are pretty much good to go! :)
